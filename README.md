# UNMISS Flood Mapping

Challenge statement:
Weâ€™re trying to enable conflict-sensitive and effective climate adaptation efforts in South Sudan, but the lack of evidence-based analysis limits targeted and data-driven responses to existing issues.

Additional information:
The solution would enable data-driven projections of climate impacts in South Sudan by identifying areas that will experience new and exceptional flooding in the mid-term (5-10 years) and long-term (10+ years), highlighting regions most at risk of drought, pinpointing areas where climate impacts may exacerbate violent conflict, and identifying what kind of climate adaption and nature-based solutions could be suitable.

Background:
South Sudan faces severe climate impacts, including droughts, floods, and rising temperatures, threatening livelihoods, food security, and peace. Ranked as the second most climate-vulnerable country, resource competition and worsening weather exacerbate and hinder development, increasing humanitarian and security risks.


Utilizing satellite imagery to identify areas likely to experience new and extreme flooding over the mid-term (5-10 years) and long-term (10+ years).
Highlighting regions at high risk of drought and water scarcity.
Pinpointing locations where climate impacts may escalate violent conflict.
Recommending nature-based solutions and climate adaptation strategies tailored to local conditions.
Incorporating community-driven data via SMS-based systems (Mechanical Turk models) to improve real-time assessments.


Addressing climate change in South Sudan requires a conflict-sensitive, evidence-based approach. By leveraging data-driven projections, community-driven insights, and nature-based solutions, this initiative aims to mitigate climate risks, enhance resilience, and contribute to sustainable peace and development.
